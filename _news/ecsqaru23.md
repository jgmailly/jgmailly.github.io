I have participated to [ECSQARU 2023](https://www.cril.univ-artois.fr/ecsqaru23/), organized in my city of
Arras. I had two accepted papers:
- Revisiting Approximate Reasoning based on Grounded Semantics (presented by [Julien Rossit](https://helios2.mi.parisdescartes.fr/~jrossit/)),
- Extension-based Semantics for Incomplete Argumentation Frameworks:
  Grounded Semantics and Principles (presented by myself).
