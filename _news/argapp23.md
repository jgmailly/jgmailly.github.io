It was a pleasure to organize the first [Arg&App workshop](https://argapp-workshop.github.io), with
[Oana Cocarascu](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/oana-cocarascu), [Sylvie Doutre](https://sites.google.com/view/sylviedoutre) and [Antonio Rago](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~afr114/). We warmly
thank [Antonis Kakas](http://www.cs.ucy.ac.cy/~antonis/) who gave an invited talk, and
[Andreas Niskanen](https://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/andreasn/) who announced the results of the Fifth
[International Competition on Computational Models of Argumentation](http://argumentationcompetition.org).
