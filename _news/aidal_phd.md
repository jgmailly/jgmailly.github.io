We are searching for a candidate with a Master degree in Computer Science, with knowledge about Artificial Intelligence (Knowledge Representation and Reasoning, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing) and a strong interest for interdisciplinary work.

The PhD student will work on 
1. the definition of argumentation formalisms allowing the representation of context-sensitive information (e.g. contextual preferences between arguments); 
2. the extraction of such argumentative information from legal text.
