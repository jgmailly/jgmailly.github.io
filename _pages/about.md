I studied computer science at [Université d'Artois, Lens, France](http://www.univ-artois.fr/L-universite/UFR-et-IUT/Sciences) where
I obtained my Bachelor degree (2010) and my Master degree (2012). My
Ph.D. on the topic Dynamics of Argumentation Frameworks has been
supervised by [Sylvie Coste-Marquis](http://www.cril.univ-artois.fr/~coste/), [Sébastien Konieczny](http://www.cril.univ-artois.fr/~konieczny/sebastien.php?page=index&lang=gb) and [Pierre
Marquis](http://www.cril.univ-artois.fr/~marquis/Home,_sweet_home.html), from [CRIL](http://www.cril.univ-artois.fr/en). I defended my thesis in September 2015.

From October 2015 to August 2016, I was working as Project Assistant at [Database and Artificial Intelligence Group](http://www.dbai.tuwien.ac.at/) from the [Faculty for Informatics](http://www.informatik.tuwien.ac.at/english), [TU Wien](http://www.tuwien.ac.at/en/tuwien_home/).
From September 2016 to February 2024, I was an Associate Professor in the
[Department of Mathematics and Computer Science](https://math-info.u-paris.fr/)
at [Université Paris Cité](https://u-paris.fr/), where I was a member of the
[LIPADE](http://lipade.mi.parisdescartes.fr/) laboratory, within the
[Distributed Artificial Intelligence
Group](http://dai.mi.parisdescartes.fr/).

Since March 2024, I am a Junior Professor in the [Faculty of
Information
Technology](https://www.ut-capitole.fr/home/the-university/faculties-schools/faculty-of-information-technology)
at [Université Toulouse Capitole](https://www.ut-capitole.fr/home),
where I am the holder of the chair Artificial Intelligence, Data,
Algorithms and Law (AIDAL). I
joined the [LILaC](https://www.irit.fr/en/departement/dep-artificial-intelligence/lilac-team/) team of [IRIT](https://www.irit.fr).
