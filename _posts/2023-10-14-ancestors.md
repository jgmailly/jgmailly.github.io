A few years ago, I discovered the
[Mathematics Genealogy Project](https://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/),
which lists many scientists and their supervisor-student
relations. This allows to draw ''genealogy trees'' where ''parents''
are actually the Ph.D. supervisors of the ''child''. I somehow forgot
about that until a recent conversation with Sébastien Konieczny (one
of my Ph.D. supervisors) and Ramon Pino-Perez (Sébastien's supervisor,
so my ''academic grand-father).

This conducted me to some research on the genealogy project, to
discover that Pierre Marquis and Sylvie Coste-Marquis (my other two supervisors) were both
supervised by Jean-Paul Haton, and unfortunately there is no
information regarding his academic ancestors, so I cannot go further
in the past from him. But Ramon already had some information about his
genealogic tree, and so, of course, mine!

The details are [here](/assets/pdf/genealogy-graph-ramon.pdf), but I
can still give some interesting information about my most famous
ancestors:
- [Michel Chasles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Chasles)
  (1793-1880), known for
  [Chasles' theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chasles%27_theorem_(gravitation)),
- [Siméon Denis Poisson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siméon_Denis_Poisson)
  (1781-1840), known for the [Poisson distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution),
- [Joseph-Louis Lagrange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph-Louis_Lagrange)
  (1736-1813), known for
  [variational calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_of_variations),
- [Pierre-Simon de Laplace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Simon_de_Laplace)
  (1749-1827), known for the
  [Laplace transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace_transform)
  and [Laplace's equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace%27s_equation),
- [Leonhard Euler ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler)
  (1707-1783), known for some many contributions in
  [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributions_of_Leonhard_Euler_to_mathematics)
  that I won't make a list,
- [Jean le Rond d'Alembert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_le_Rond_d%27Alembert)
  (1717-1783), known for
  [d'Alembert's formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%27Alembert%27s_formula)
  and the [Encyclopédie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclopédie),
- [Johann Bernoulli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Bernoulli)
  (1667-1748), known for
  [Bernoulli's rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27Hôpital%27s_rule)
  and the
  [Sophomore's dream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophomore%27s_dream),
- [Jacob Bernoulli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Bernoulli) (1655-1705) known for [Bernoulli differential equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_differential_equation).
