I've had the pleasure, recently, to attend to the 6th BRAON workshop (my fourth participation!). BRAON gathers researchers interested in various subfields of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning, notably belief change and argumentation which are my main domains of research. BRAON are usually the occasion of creating or strengthening research collaborations, and to discuss interesting ideas that can lead to future work.

This year, I've been involved in interesting discussions about the relations between argumentation, explainability and dialogues. Who knows, the ideas discussed during these sessions may lead to some contributions on this topic :)
