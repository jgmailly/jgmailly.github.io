I was in charge of this course at Université Paris Cité.

This course, destined to students in the first year of our Master in
Computer Science program (M1), presents various subfield of Knowledge
Representation and Reasoning:
- classical (propositional and first order) logic,
- classical planning,
- abstract argumentation.

This course is shared with two colleagues. I am in charge of the
lectures and tutorials for the part on abstract argumentation:
- basic notions of abstract argumentation (Dung's framework and
extension-based semantics),
- introduction to argumentation dynamics.

In 2023-2024, my teaching load is:
  - 4.5 hours of lectures,
  - 4.5 hours of tutorials.
