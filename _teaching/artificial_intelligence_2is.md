I am in charge of this course at Universit√© Toulouse Capitole.

This course, destined to students in the first year of our Master on Innovative Information Systems (M1 2IS), presents basic notions in different subfields of Artificial Intelligence:
- search algorithms and heuristics (DFS, BFS, A*),
- problem solving with Boolean Satisfiability and Constraints Programming,
- introduction to Machine Learning.

I was in charge of practical works in 2025, and will give the lectures in 2026.
