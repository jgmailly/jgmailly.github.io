title: Algorithmic Complexity
description: M1 course
importance: 1
category: Master
---

This course, destined to students in the first year of our Master in Computer Science program (M1), presents basic notions of computational complexity:
- Turing machines and decidability,
- time complexity: P, NP, coNP and the polynomial hierarchy,
- space complexity: L, NL, PSPACE.

A quick look to more advanced concepts (Boolean hierarchy, parameterized complexity) concludes the course.

I am in charge of the lectures and tutorials. In 2023-2024, my teaching load is:
- 15 hours of lectures,
- 30 hours of tutorials.
