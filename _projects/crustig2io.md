[crusti_g2io](https://www.cril.univ-artois.fr/software/crustig2io/) is
a graph generator based on the notion of community of nodes. It is
particularly focused on the generation of abstract argumentation
frameworks. A preliminary version was used for providing benchmarks at
the Fourth [International Competition on Computational Models of
Argumentation](http://argumentationcompetition.org) (ICCMA 2021), and crusti_g2io itself was used by ICCMA
2023 organisers.
