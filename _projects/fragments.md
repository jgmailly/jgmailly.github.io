During my postdoc at TU Wien, I was a member of the project
[Fragment-Driven Belief Change](http://www.dbai.tuwien.ac.at/research/project/beliefchange/),
which aimed at studying belief change operation in non-standard
fragments of classical logic, or non-classical formalisms like
abstract argumentation.
