The project [AMANDE](http://amande.lip6.fr/) was supported by the French National Research Agency (ANR) (2013-2018).

**Objective :** Theoretical foundations for the aggregation of arguments coming from multiple sources

Debating and exchanging arguments is a fundamental human activity, studied for a long time. But considering that it is already difficult to evaluate which of two debaters was the most convincing, how can we handle debates where participants can be counted in dozens, even more? Online deliberation platforms makes this prospect real: on such platforms, pieces of information (more or less credible) are exchanged in order to build up a "collective opinion". These pieces of information can be arguments, but people may also vote on arguments put forward by other parties. How can we make sense of this constellation of viewpoints? Is there any well-founded method to aggregate them, to analyze the resulting debates (for instance, so as to single out the best justified ones?). And in a normative perspective, can we conceive and design systems enjoying good properties (that the debate evolved correctly, that the viewpoints were fairly represented, that the outcome reached was satisfying for all the parties, etc.)
