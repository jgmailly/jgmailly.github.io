[CoQuiAAS](https://www.cril.univ-artois.fr/software/coquiaas/) is a
C++ implementation of SAT-based techniques for solving abstract
argumentation problems.

It has participated several times to the [International Competition on
Computational Models of Argumentation](http://argumentationcompetition.org), and it was ranked:
- first in 2015,
- first in the grounded semantics track in 2017,
- second in 2019.

CoQuiAAS is not maintained anymore, it has evolved in [Crustabri](https://www.cril.univ-artois.fr/software/crustabri/).
