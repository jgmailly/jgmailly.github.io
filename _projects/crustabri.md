[Crustabri](https://www.cril.univ-artois.fr/software/crustabri/) is a
Rust implementation of SAT-based techniques for abstract
argumentation. It is based on CoQuiAAS (previously implemented in
C++).

Crustabri has participated to the Fifth [International Competition on
Computational Models of Argumentation](http://argumentationcompetition.org)
(ICCMA 2023), and it was ranked first in 9 subtracks of the main track (over 13 subtracks), and all 3
subtracks of the dynamic track:
- Main track: DC-ST, DC-STG, DS-SST, DS-ST, DS-STG, SE-PR, SE-SST, SE-ST, SE-STG;
- Dynamic track: DC-CO, DC-ST, DS-ST.
